    			Dunky dunky, what's in the trunky? Not satisfaction, that's for sure! <strong>Cafde's Quest</strong> answers the burning question: <em>When life gives you sugar cubes, what do you do?</em> The answer? That's up to player interpretation. Regardless, help Cafde grab his trusty <span id="special-text">ANIME PRO</span> mug and keep his coffee untainted for as long as possible. That's right, we put your brand in their hand! There is no winning in this cruel world.
